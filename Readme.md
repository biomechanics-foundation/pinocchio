> **Warning: Crate still heavily under construction**

This crate contains methods for kinematics and rigging, and dynamics in biomechanics applications
and animation. It contains data structures and visitor algorithms for handling tree structures, and
will support multiple algebra packages (planned: [ndarray](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray),
[ngalgebra](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra), [faer](https://github.com/sarah-ek/faer-rs),
[glam](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs))
